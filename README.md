# Lab Programs

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of short lab programs and small coding exercises. These programs are primarily focused on practicing core programming concepts and experimenting with logic in a lightweight setup.

## Purpose
- Practice fundamental programming concepts
- Test small ideas and logic quickly
- Maintain a personal archive of lab-level experiments

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript

## Development Notes
Most of the code here was written quickly for experimentation and learning, following a flexible **vibe coding** approach rather than production-level structure.

## Usage
Each file can be run or reviewed independently based on the specific lab task or concept being explored.
